### CS 81 Module 8 Assignment 8A: Cookie Clicker Tracker, by GregH, 7/22/25
**asteroidClicker.html** encourages the user to click a button with the asteroid/comet emoji on it and awards points for doing so. At certain numbers of points, the page displays a reward message. I wrote asteroidClicker.html.

**betterAsteroidClicker.html** was written by Copilot in VSCode at my prompting, based on asteroidClicker.html. It randomly displays either the asteroid/comet emoji or another emoji and awards or deducts points according to whether the user correctly decides if it's an asteroid or not. At certain numbers of points, the page displays a reward message.

**REFLECTION.md** has my answers to questions about how I understood the concept, how I personalized my project, what surprised me, and real-world applications.
