### CS 81 Module 8 Assignment 8A: Cookie Clicker Tracker, by GregH, 7/22/25
# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
Seeing that in the HTML, I can assign an ID to an element, and in the JavaScript I can grab that element by its ID and store it in a variable, and then apply a method to the variable to change what's displayed in that element, makes sense. It's actually pretty simple.
## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I based them on the assignment instructions, but I tried to imagine how someone would be described, or what title they might be given, if they display various levels of commitment to hunting asteroids. The instructions' final message suggested taking a break; so I included a similar suggestion in my final message.
## What challenge or bug surprised you?
The biggest challenge was getting the font sizes and margins to look good to me. I don't remember encountering any bugs. I might have almost caused a bug by trying to name both the HTML element and the JavaScript counter variable 'score'. I immediately realized that was a bad idea and changed the HTML element to 'scoreDisplay'.
## What personal twist did you add?
Instead of Cookie Clicker, I made it an Asteroid Clicker, with an asteroid-themed background image and an asteroid (or comet) emoji on the button, and milestone messages to match. I also got Copilot to write a version that randomly displays various emojis and adds or deducts points based on whether the user correctly decides if the emoji is an asteroid. So I'm including that version in my repo. To be clear, Copilot wrote that version (betterAsteroidClicker.html), but I wrote the version that follows the assignment's instructions (asteroidClicker.html).
## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Browsers and PDF viewers usually have buttons to zoom in or out, and word processors have buttons to make the font bigger or smaller. Those are very similar to this interaction.
